# The Scales of Judgement

The **Construct 3** folder is for C3 enthusiasts. All the rest relates to the HTML5 version of the game.

The game is a pulse-pounding shooter where you need to scale to the top using the bodies of your enemies. The more bodies pile up, the faster the Scales of Judgement start sinking.
